## ðŸ“¦ Monorepo Structure

This repository is a monorepo managed with npm workspaces. The project is divided into `apps` and `packages`.

### Apps

These are the main applications of the project.

-   `apps/desktop`: The Electron-based desktop application. This is the main user-facing client.
-   `apps/api`: The serverless backend service responsible for fetching, processing, and delivering news data.

### Packages

These are shared modules used across the applications.

-   `packages/shared-types`: Contains shared TypeScript types and interfaces (e.g., `NewsItem`, `FilterSettings`) to ensure type safety between the API and the desktop client.
-   `packages/eslint-config-custom`: Holds the shared ESLint configuration to enforce consistent coding standards across the entire codebase.
-   `packages/tsconfig-custom`: Provides a base TypeScript `tsconfig.json` for all other packages to inherit from, ensuring consistent compiler settings.
