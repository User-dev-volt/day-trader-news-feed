## Goals and Background Context

**Goals**

*   Provide day traders with a tangible "entry timing advantage" on volatile stocks.
*   Enable users to create highly specific, personalized filters to isolate relevant news.
*   Become an essential, indispensable tool in the daily workflow of niche day traders.
*   Drastically reduce the time users spend manually searching for actionable information.

**Background Context**

Day traders specializing in niche, volatile stocks (e.g., small-caps with low float) are currently overwhelmed by the volume of market news. They lack tools with the granular filtering necessary to isolate critical, time-sensitive information, causing them to miss profitable trading opportunities. This application will solve that problem by providing a specialized, real-time aggregator that filters out market "noise" and highlights actionable news, allowing traders to make faster, more informed decisions.
