## Technical Assumptions

**Repository Structure: Monorepo**
*   We will use a "monorepo" structure, with the desktop application and the backend service in a single code repository to simplify development and code sharing.

**Service Architecture: Serverless**
*   We will build the backend using a "serverless" architecture to align with the "low-cost" constraint (NFR4) and provide automatic scaling.

**Testing Requirements: Unit + Integration Tests**
*   The development team will be required to write both unit tests and integration tests to ensure a strong level of quality for the MVP.

**Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests**
*   The backend must be capable of basic keyword analysis to identify "broad market-moving news" for the importance-ranking feature (FR5).
*   The backend architecture must include an abstraction layer to isolate the core application logic from the specific news API provider, making it easier to switch providers in the future.
*   A CI/CD pipeline will be established early in the project to automate the building, testing, and deployment of both the backend service and the desktop application.
*   The project must support a straightforward local development setup that allows for easy testing of the end-to-end system.
