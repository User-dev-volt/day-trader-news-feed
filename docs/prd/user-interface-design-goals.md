## User Interface Design Goals

**Overall UX Vision**
The application's user experience should be fast, intuitive, and data-dense without feeling cluttered. The user must feel empowered and "ahead of the market," trusting the app to deliver critical information instantly. The design should be professional, clean, and focused, minimizing any distractions from the core task of analyzing news.

**Key Interaction Paradigms**
*   **Real-time Feed:** The primary interaction is observing a live, auto-updating list of news.
*   **Popup Filters:** Users will click a 'Filter' button to open a popup for creating and managing filters, keeping the main feed clean.
*   **At-a-Glance Insights:** The UI will use strong visual cues (like the glowing, color-coded borders) for rapid assessment of news importance.

**Core Screens and Views**
*   **Main Dashboard:** For the MVP, the application will consist of a single, primary screen housing the 'Filter' button and the main real-time news feed.

**Accessibility: None**
*   To meet the initial timeline, advanced accessibility will not be a primary focus for the MVP but can be incorporated in future versions.

**Branding**
*   The application will adopt a clean, professional "fin-tech" aesthetic, with a dark mode theme to reduce eye strain.

**Target Device and Platforms: Desktop Only**
*   This will be a Desktop Only application, initially targeting the Windows operating system.
