title: "Story 2.9: Real-time Filter Adjustments"
---

### Status
- [ ] Draft
- [X] Approved
- [ ] In Progress
- [ ] Review
- [ ] Done

### Story
**As a** user,
**I want** to see the news feed update in real-time as I adjust the filter controls,
**so that** I can get immediate feedback on my filter's effectiveness without having to click 'Apply'.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. An 'Enable Real-time Updates' toggle is added to the filter popup.
2. When enabled, any change to a filter control (e.g., sliding a price range, typing a keyword) immediately triggers a backend request and updates the news feed.
3. When disabled, the 'Apply' button is required to update the feed.
4. The real-time update feature is designed to be efficient, possibly using a debounce mechanism to avoid excessive API calls.

### Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] **Task 1: Add Real-time Toggle** (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Add an 'Enable Real-time Updates' toggle switch to the filter popup component.
- [ ] **Task 2: Implement Real-time Logic** (AC: 2, 3, 4)
  - [ ] When the toggle is enabled, add event listeners to the filter controls.
  - [ ] Use a debounce mechanism to trigger the API call after a short delay.
  - [ ] When the toggle is disabled, remove the event listeners.
- [ ] **Task 3: Unit Tests**
  - [ ] Write unit tests for the real-time update logic.

### Dev Notes
- **Frontend Architecture:** The new toggle and real-time logic will be part of the filter popup component. [Source: docs/architecture/10-frontend-architecture.md]
- **State Management:** Use Zustand to manage the real-time update state. [Source: docs/architecture/3-tech-stack.md]
- **Project Structure:** The relevant components are in `apps/desktop/src/components/filters`. [Source: docs/architecture/12-unified-project-structure.md]

#### Testing
- **Testing Framework:** Use Vitest and React Testing Library for unit tests. [Source: docs/architecture/16-testing-strategy.md]
- **Test File Location:** Test files should be located next to the component files. [Source: docs/architecture/16-testing-strategy.md]
