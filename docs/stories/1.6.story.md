### Story

As a user, I want each news item in the list to be a clickable link, so that I can open the original source article to read the full story.

### Acceptance Criteria

1.  Each news item in the UI is a hyperlink.
2.  Clicking the link opens the item's `sourceUrl` in the user's default web browser.

### Dev Notes

*   **Electron Shell:** We will use Electron's `shell.openExternal()` method to open the links in the default browser. This is a security best practice as it avoids opening external content within the application's context.

### Tasks / Subtasks

*   [x] **Task 1: Make News Items Clickable (AC: 1)**
    *   [x] Wrap the `NewsItem` component in an anchor tag (`<a>`) or a clickable element.
*   [x] **Task 2: Implement Link Opening (AC: 2)**
    *   [x] Create a click handler for the news item.
    -   [x] Inside the handler, call `shell.openExternal()` with the `sourceUrl` from the news item data.

### Testing

*   Manual testing is sufficient.
*   Validation will involve clicking on several news items in the desktop application and confirming they open in the default web browser.

### QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-08-24

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

The implementation is clean and follows the security best practice of using Electron's `shell.openExternal()` method. The code is well-structured with proper error handling for the Electron API availability.

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: `apps/desktop/src/components/NewsFeed.tsx`
  - **Change**: Added null safety check for `window.electron.shell.openExternal`
  - **Why**: To prevent runtime errors when Electron API is not available (e.g., in testing environment)
  - **How**: Added conditional check with optional chaining and fallback warning message

- **File**: `apps/desktop/src/test/setup.ts`
  - **Change**: Added mock for `window.electron.shell.openExternal`
  - **Why**: To provide proper test environment for Electron API calls
  - **How**: Mocked the Electron shell API using Vitest's `vi.fn()`

- **File**: `apps/desktop/src/electron.d.ts`
  - **Change**: Added TypeScript declaration for `window.electron`
  - **Why**: To provide proper type definitions for the Electron API
  - **How**: Created type declaration for the window interface extension

- **File**: `apps/desktop/src/services/api.test.ts`
  - **Change**: Updated mock NewsItem to include all required properties
  - **Why**: To fix TypeScript compilation errors in tests
  - **How**: Added missing properties: timestamp, tickers, sourceUrl, importanceLevel

- **File**: `apps/desktop/src/store/newsStore.test.ts`
  - **Change**: Updated mock NewsItem to include all required properties
  - **Why**: To fix TypeScript compilation errors in tests
  - **How**: Added missing properties: timestamp, tickers, sourceUrl, importanceLevel

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ All code follows project conventions and TypeScript best practices
- Project Structure: ✓ Files are in correct locations with proper naming
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Tests are passing, proper mocking in place for Electron APIs
- All ACs Met: ✓ Both acceptance criteria are fully implemented

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] Added null safety check for Electron API availability
- [x] Created proper TypeScript declarations for window.electron
- [x] Fixed test data to include all required NewsItem properties
- [x] Added proper test mocking for Electron shell API
- [x] All linting issues resolved
- [x] Build process now completes successfully

### Security Review

✓ Security best practices followed - using `shell.openExternal()` prevents opening external content within application context, which is the recommended approach for Electron applications.

### Performance Considerations

✓ No performance concerns identified. The implementation is lightweight and uses the native Electron API efficiently.

### Files Modified During Review

- `apps/desktop/src/components/NewsFeed.tsx` - Added null safety check
- `apps/desktop/src/test/setup.ts` - Added Electron API mock
- `apps/desktop/src/electron.d.ts` - Added TypeScript declarations
- `apps/desktop/src/services/api.test.ts` - Fixed test data
- `apps/desktop/src/store/newsStore.test.ts` - Fixed test data

### Gate Status

Gate: PASS → docs/qa/gates/1.6-clickable-news-links.yml
