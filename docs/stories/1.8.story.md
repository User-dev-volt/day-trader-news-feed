### Story

As a user, I want the desktop application to be packaged as a standalone Windows executable, so that I can easily install and run it on my computer.

### Acceptance Criteria

1.  A build process is created that generates a single `.exe` file.
2.  The executable can be run on a clean Windows machine without requiring developer tools.
3.  The packaged application functions identically to the development version.

### Dev Notes

*   **Packaging Tool:** We will use `electron-builder` to package the application. [Source: G:\day trader news feed\day-trader-news-feed\docs\architecture\13-development-workflow.md]
*   **Build Target:** The initial build will target Windows. [Source: G:\day trader news feed\day-trader-news-feed\docs\architecture\14-deployment-architecture.md]

### Tasks / Subtasks

*   [ ] **Task 1: Add Electron Builder (AC: 1)**
    *   [ ] Add `electron-builder` as a development dependency to the `desktop` package.
    *   [ ] Configure `electron-builder` in the `package.json` or a separate configuration file.
*   [ ] **Task 2: Create Build Script (AC: 1)**
    *   [ ] Add a `build` script to the `desktop/package.json` that runs `electron-builder`.
*   [ ] **Task 3: Test Packaged Application (AC: 2, 3)**
    *   [ ] Run the build script to generate the executable.
    *   [ ] Test the executable on a clean Windows machine to ensure it runs and functions correctly.

### Testing

*   Manual testing is required.
*   The packaged `.exe` file will be installed and run on a separate Windows machine to verify its functionality.
