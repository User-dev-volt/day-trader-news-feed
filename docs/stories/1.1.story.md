### Story

As a developer, I want a properly configured monorepo with separate packages for the desktop app and the backend service, so that we have a clean, organized, and scalable foundation for development.

### Acceptance Criteria

1.  A new monorepo is created using the chosen tooling.
2.  A placeholder 'desktop' application package is created within an `apps` directory.
3.  A placeholder 'api' package is created within the `apps` directory.
4.  Shared linting and TypeScript configurations are set up across the monorepo.
5.  The initial project structure should follow the guidelines in `docs/architecture/source-tree.md`.

### Dev Notes

*   **Monorepo Tooling:** We will use npm workspaces, as it's the simplest and most standard choice for a new TypeScript project. [Source: G:\day trader news feed\day-trader-news-feed\docs\architecture\12-unified-project-structure.md]
*   **Project Structure:** The initial project structure should follow the guidelines in `docs/architecture/source-tree.md`. [Source: G:\day trader news feed\day-trader-news-feed\docs\architecture\source-tree.md]
    *   `apps/desktop`: Will contain the Electron-based desktop application. [Source: G:\day trader news feed\day-trader-news-feed\docs\architecture\3-tech-stack.md]
    *   `apps/api`: Will contain the serverless backend service. [Source: G:\day trader news feed\day-trader-news-feed\docs\architecture\3-tech-stack.md]
    *   `packages/shared-types`: For sharing data structures (e.g., `NewsItem`) between the `api` and `desktop` apps. [Source: G:\day trader news feed\day-trader-news-feed\docs\architecture\17-coding-standards.md]
    *   `packages/eslint-config-custom`: For a shareable ESLint configuration. [Source: G:\day trader news feed\day-trader-news-feed\docs\architecture\17-coding-standards.md]
    *   `packages/tsconfig-custom`: For a shareable TypeScript `tsconfig.json`. [Source: G:\day trader news feed\day-trader-news-feed\docs\architecture\17-coding-standards.md]

### Tasks / Subtasks

*   [x] **Task 1: Initialize Monorepo (AC: 1)**
    *   [x] Initialize a `package.json` in the root directory.
    *   [x] Configure npm workspaces to recognize the `apps/*` and `packages/*` directories.
*   [x] **Task 2: Create Application Packages (AC: 2, 3, 5)**
    *   [x] Create the `apps/desktop` directory with a basic `package.json`.
    *   [x] Create the `apps/api` directory with a basic `package.json`.
*   [x] **Task 3: Set Up Shared Configurations (AC: 4)**
    *   [x] Create the `packages/eslint-config-custom` directory with a base ESLint configuration file.
    *   [x] Create the `packages/tsconfig-custom` directory with a base `tsconfig.json` file.
    *   [x] Configure the root `package.json` to install these shared packages into the development dependencies.
*   [x] **Task 4: Initial Dependency Installation**
    *   [x] Run `npm install` to link the workspaces and install initial dependencies.
*   [x] **Task 5: Documentation**
    *   [x] Create a basic `README.md` in the root explaining the monorepo structure and how to get started.

### Testing

*   No specific unit tests are required for this scaffolding story.
*   Validation will be done by confirming the directory structure and the success of `npm install`. [Source: G:\day trader news feed\day-trader-news-feed\docs\architecture\16-testing-strategy.md]
