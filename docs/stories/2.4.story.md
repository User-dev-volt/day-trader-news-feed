### Status
- [ ] Draft
- [X] Approved
- [ ] In Progress
- [ ] Review
- [ ] Done

### Story
**As a** user,
**I want** my filter settings to be saved when I close and reopen the application,
**so that** I don't have to re-enter them every time.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. The filter settings are saved to local storage on the user's machine whenever the 'Apply' button is clicked.
2. When the application starts, it checks for saved filter settings in local storage.
3. If saved settings are found, they are automatically applied to the news feed on startup.
4. The filter popup UI reflects the currently active (saved) filter settings when opened.

### Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] **Task 1: Save Filter Settings** (AC: 1)
  - [ ] In the 'Apply' button `onClick` handler, save the filter settings to local storage.
- [ ] **Task 2: Load Filter Settings** (AC: 2, 3)
  - [ ] When the application starts, read the filter settings from local storage.
  - [ ] If settings exist, apply them to the news feed.
- [ ] **Task 3: Update Filter Popup** (AC: 4)
  - [ ] When the filter popup is opened, populate the input fields with the saved filter settings.
- [ ] **Task 4: Unit Tests**
  - [ ] Write unit tests for the local storage logic.

### Dev Notes
- **Data Models:** The `FilterPreset` data model defines the structure of the filter settings. [Source: docs/architecture/4-data-models.md]
- **State Management:** Use Zustand to manage the filter settings. [Source: docs/architecture/3-tech-stack.md]
- **Project Structure:** The relevant components are located in `apps/desktop/src/components`. [Source: docs/architecture/12-unified-project-structure.md]

#### Testing
- **Testing Framework:** Use Vitest and React Testing Library for unit tests. [Source: docs/architecture/16-testing-strategy.md]
- **Test File Location:** Test files should be located next to the component files. [Source: docs/architecture/16-testing-strategy.md]
