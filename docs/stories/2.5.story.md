### Story
**As a** user,
**I want** a way to clear my active filter and see the full, unfiltered news feed again,
**so that** I can easily switch back to a broad market view.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. When a filter is active, a 'Clear Filter' button appears on the Main Dashboard.
2. Clicking the 'Clear Filter' button removes all active filters.
3. The news feed updates to show the full, unfiltered list of news.
4. The 'Clear Filter' button disappears, and the visual indicator for an active filter is removed.
5. The saved filter settings in local storage are cleared.

### Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] **Task 1: Create Clear Filter Button** (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Create a new React component for the 'Clear Filter' button.
  - [ ] Conditionally render the button on the Main Dashboard only when a filter is active.
- [ ] **Task 2: Implement Clear Filter Logic** (AC: 2, 3, 4, 5)
  - [ ] Add an `onClick` handler to the 'Clear Filter' button.
  - [ ] The handler should clear the filter settings in the Zustand store.
  - [ ] The handler should clear the filter settings in local storage.
  - [ ] The handler should fetch the full, unfiltered news feed.
- [ ] **Task 3: Unit Tests**
  - [ ] Write unit tests for the 'Clear Filter' button component.
  - [ ] Write unit tests for the clear filter logic.

### Dev Notes
- **State Management:** Use Zustand to manage the active filter state. [Source: docs/architecture/3-tech-stack.md]
- **UI Component Library:** Use Shadcn/UI and Tailwind CSS for the UI components. [Source: docs/architecture/3-tech-stack.md]
- **Project Structure:** The relevant components are located in `apps/desktop/src/components`. [Source: docs/architecture/12-unified-project-structure.md]

#### Testing
- **Testing Framework:** Use Vitest and React Testing Library for unit tests. [Source: docs/architecture/16-testing-strategy.md]
- **Test File Location:** Test files should be located next to the component files. [Source: docs/architecture/16-testing-strategy.md]
