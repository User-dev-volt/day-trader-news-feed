### Story

As a user, I want a basic desktop application window that displays a simple, scrollable list area, so that I can see the basic structure of the news feed.

### Acceptance Criteria

1.  A Windows desktop application can be launched, showing a single main window.
2.  The window contains a component designed to display a list of news articles.
3.  The UI is styled with the basic dark mode theme.
4.  The application does not yet fetch or display any data.

### Dev Notes

*   **Framework:** The UI will be built with React and Vite, running inside an Electron shell. [Source: G:\day trader news feed\day-trader-news-feed\docs\architecture\3-tech-stack.md]
*   **Styling:** We will use TailwindCSS for styling. [Source: G:\day trader news feed\day-trader-news-feed\docs\architecture\3-tech-stack.md]
*   **Component Library:** We will use Shadcn/UI for pre-built components. [Source: G:\day trader news feed\day-trader-news-feed\docs\architecture\3-tech-stack.md]

### Tasks / Subtasks

*   [x] **Task 1: Create Main Window (AC: 1)**
    *   [x] Configure Electron to create a main browser window.
    *   [x] Load the React application into the window.
*   [x] **Task 2: Create List Component (AC: 2)**
    *   [x] Create a new React component for the news feed list.
    *   [x] Add a placeholder in the main app component to display the list.
*   [x] **Task 3: Apply Basic Styling (AC: 3)**
    *   [x] Configure TailwindCSS for a dark mode theme.
    *   [x] Apply basic styling to the main window and list component.

### Testing

*   Manual testing is sufficient.
*   Validation will be done by launching the application and visually inspecting the UI.
