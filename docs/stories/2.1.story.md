### Dev Notes

- **State Management:** Use Zustand for managing the state of the filter popup. [Source: docs/architecture/3-tech-stack.md]
- **UI Component Library:** Use Shadcn/UI and Tailwind CSS for building the UI components. [Source: docs/architecture/3-tech-stack.md]
- **Project Structure:** Place new components in the `apps/desktop/src/components/filters` directory. [Source: docs/architecture/12-unified-project-structure.md]

#### Testing
- **Testing Framework:** Use Vitest and React Testing Library for unit tests. [Source: docs/architecture/16-testing-strategy.md]
