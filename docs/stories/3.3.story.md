### Story
**As a** user,
**I want** access to helpful tooltips and a manual refresh button,
**so that** I can better understand the UI features and have more control over the data feed.

### Acceptance Criteria
1.  Hovering over interactive elements like the 'Filter' button displays a helpful tooltip explaining its function.
2.  A 'Refresh' button is added to the Main Dashboard.
3.  Clicking the 'Refresh' button immediately triggers a new data fetch from the backend.
