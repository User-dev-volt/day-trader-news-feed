### Status
- [ ] Draft
- [x] Approved
- [ ] In Progress
- [ ] Review

### Story
**As a** user,
**I want** to see a color-coded, glowing border around news items,
**so that** I can instantly understand their potential importance without having to read each headline.

### Acceptance Criteria
1.  The UI consumes the `importanceLevel` field from the API response for each news item.
2.  News items are displayed with different border colors and/or glow effects corresponding to their importance level.
3.  The visual effect is clear and immediate but does not make the interface feel cluttered.

### Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] **Task 1: Update News Item Component** (AC: 1, 2)
    - [ ] Modify the `NewsItem` component in `apps/desktop/src/components/feed` to accept the `importanceLevel` prop. [Source: docs/architecture/10-frontend-architecture.md]
    - [ ] Use Tailwind CSS to apply different border colors and glow effects based on the `importanceLevel`. [Source: docs/architecture/3-tech-stack.md]
- [ ] **Task 2: Update API Client Service** (AC: 1)
    - [ ] Ensure the `API Client Service` correctly fetches and passes the `importanceLevel` to the `NewsItem` component. [Source: docs/architecture/10-frontend-architecture.md]
- [ ] **Task 3: UI/UX Polish** (AC: 3)
    - [ ] Ensure the visual effects are aesthetically pleasing and do not clutter the UI.
    - [ ] Consult with a UX designer if necessary.
- [ ] **Task 4: Unit Tests**
    - [ ] Write unit tests for the updated `NewsItem` component using Vitest and React Testing Library. [Source: docs/architecture/16-testing-strategy.md]
