### Story

As a developer, I want the backend service to connect to the live news API and return real news data, so that the application uses live, real-world data.

### Acceptance Criteria

1.  An API abstraction layer is created in the backend to isolate the external provider.
2.  The backend service successfully fetches news from the selected third-party API.
3.  API keys are stored securely and are not hardcoded in the source.
4.  The data returned to the client correctly uses the shared `NewsItem` type.

### Dev Notes

*   **API Provider:** We will use the Polygon.io API as specified in the architecture. [Source: G:\day trader news feed\day-trader-news-feed\docs\architecture\7-external-apis.md]
*   **Security:** API keys will be stored as environment variables in Vercel. [Source: G:\day trader news feed\day-trader-news-feed\docs\architecture\15-security-and-performance.md]
*   **Data Mapping:** A function will be needed to map the data from the Polygon.io API format to our internal `NewsItem` format. [Source: G:\day trader news feed\day-trader-news-feed\docs\architecture\4-data-models.md]

### Tasks / Subtasks

*   [x] **Task 1: Create API Abstraction (AC: 1)**
    *   [x] Create a new service in the `api` package to handle all interactions with the external news API.
*   [x] **Task 2: Implement Live API Call (AC: 2)**
    *   [x] Implement the logic to call the Polygon.io news endpoint.
    *   [x] Replace the mock data in the main serverless function with the live data.
*   [x] **Task 3: Secure API Keys (AC: 3)**
    *   [x] Add the Polygon.io API key to the Vercel environment variables.
    *   [x] Update the code to read the API key from the environment.
*   [x] **Task 4: Map Data to Shared Type (AC: 4)**
    *   [x] Create a mapping function to transform the API response into the `NewsItem` format.
    *   [x] Ensure the data returned from the serverless function conforms to the `NewsItem` interface.

**Final Confirmation:**
- [x] I, the Developer Agent, confirm that all applicable items above have been addressed.

### Testing

*   The backend service should be tested to ensure it correctly fetches and transforms the data.
*   The deployed endpoint should be manually checked to confirm it returns live news data in the correct format.

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-08-24

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

The implementation is of high quality. The developer correctly created an abstraction layer for the external API, managed API keys securely, and provided good test coverage. The code is clean, well-structured, and follows the project's standards.

### Refactoring Performed

I performed minor refactoring to improve error handling and logging.

- **File**: `apps/api/src/functions/news.ts`
  - **Change**: Added more specific error handling to differentiate between API configuration issues and other errors.
  - **Why**: This provides more meaningful error messages to the client.
  - **How**: By checking the error message for specific keywords, we can return a more specific error response.

- **File**: `apps/api/src/services/polygon.service.ts`
  - **Change**: Enhanced the error logging to include more context.
  - **Why**: This will make debugging easier by providing more information about the failed request.
  - **How**: The error log now includes the request URL and any data from the error response.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: [✓]
- Project Structure: [✓]
- Testing Strategy: [✓]
- All ACs Met: [✓]

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] Refactored error handling in the main serverless function.
- [x] Improved error logging in the Polygon.io service.

### Security Review

No security vulnerabilities were found. API keys are handled correctly via environment variables.

### Performance Considerations

No performance issues were identified. The API response time is acceptable.
