### Status

### Story
**As a** user,
**I want** to apply a filter from the popup and see the news feed update immediately to show only news that matches my criteria,
**so that** I can focus on what's important to me.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Clicking the 'Apply' button in the filter popup sends all specified criteria to the backend service.
2. The news feed on the Main Dashboard updates to display only the filtered results returned by the backend.
3. A visual indicator is present on the Main Dashboard (e.g., the 'Filter' button changes color) to show that a filter is currently active.

### Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] **Task 1: Implement 'Apply' Button Logic** (AC: 1)
  - [ ] In the filter popup component, add an `onClick` handler to the 'Apply' button.
  - [ ] The handler should gather the filter criteria from the input fields.
  - [ ] The handler should call the `API Client Service` to send the filter criteria to the backend.
- [ ] **Task 2: Update News Feed** (AC: 2)
  - [ ] In the `NewsFeed` component, update the state with the filtered news returned from the backend.
  - [ ] The component should re-render to display the filtered news.
- [ ] **Task 3: Add Visual Indicator** (AC: 3)
  - [ ] In the `MainDashboard` component, add a state to track if a filter is active.
  - [ ] When a filter is applied, set the state to active.
  - [ ] Conditionally change the color of the 'Filter' button based on the active state.
- [ ] **Task 4: Unit Tests**
  - [ ] Write unit tests for the 'Apply' button logic.
  - [ ] Write unit tests for the `NewsFeed` component to verify that it updates with filtered data.

### Dev Notes
- **API Client Service:** The `API Client Service` will be used to send the filter criteria to the backend. [Source: docs/architecture/10-frontend-architecture.md]
- **State Management:** Use Zustand to manage the state of the news feed and the active filter. [Source: docs/architecture/3-tech-stack.md]
- **UI Component Library:** Use Shadcn/UI and Tailwind CSS for the UI components. [Source: docs/architecture/3-tech-stack.md]
- **Project Structure:** The relevant components are located in `apps/desktop/src/components`. [Source: docs/architecture/12-unified-project-structure.md]

#### Testing
- **Testing Framework:** Use Vitest and React Testing Library for unit tests. [Source: docs/architecture/16-testing-strategy.md]
- **Test File Location:** Test files should be located next to the component files. [Source: docs/architecture/16-testing-strategy.md]
