# 15. Security and Performance

*   **Security:** Focus on Electron's context isolation, secure secret management on the backend, and standard web security practices.
*   **Performance:** 
    *   **Frontend:** To ensure a smooth user experience with a potentially large, continuously updating list of news items, the `NewsFeed.tsx` component will implement list virtualization using a library like `react-window` or `react-virtualized`. This will ensure that only the visible items are rendered, preventing performance degradation. Additionally, we will apply code splitting and lazy loading for any future views or heavy components to keep the initial load time minimal.
    *   **Backend:** Relies on proper database indexing, particularly on the `published_at` and `ticker` columns in the `news` table, to ensure fast query performance.
